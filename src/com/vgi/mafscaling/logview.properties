This tool was pretty much aped after www.datazap.me which is an excellent web-based application. The reason for this quickly sketched tool is to \
be able to process larger files without need for an Internet connection.
<h3>Logic:</h3>\
<p>The tool displays data in a table format, allows single column filtering, and displays data curves based on selected columns.\
