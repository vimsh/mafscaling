<h3>Credits:</h3>\
The tool is based on Mickeyd2005 spreadsheet. The usage guide is based on wrxsti-l's post. Big thanks to all who have been active in MAF scaling discussions and providing methodology - williaty, Rene2.5RS, and others.<br>\
<h3>Logic:</h3>\
<p>Logged average LTFT and STFT correction are fitted to your current MAF scaling and new scaling is suggested.<br>\
<p>The Correction error is calculated as LTFT + STFT per cell based on how far your data point is from the cell. The closest cell is determined by lookup in the original MAF scale table using (load * rpm / 60.0) MAF value.<br>\
<p>The Total Correction is then calculated for each cell as average of Correction values.<br>\
<p>The correction will only be applied to cells where count of corrections is more than 50.<br>\
<p>The corrected g/sec is calculated from the Total Correction % and the current g/sec as current_gsec * ((tot_corr% / 100) + 1).<br>\
<br>\
<h3>Usage:</h3>\
<i>You won't nail the calibration in one shot, so rinse and repeat until you're happy with the scaling. Also, it is VERY important that you collect data at a constant temperature. If you collect data at 30F one day and then 60F next week, it will totally screw up the process.</i><br><br>\
<u>Data Tab</u><br>\
<i>Note:</i><br>\
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use right mouse button click to see the menu of available actions on tables.</i><br>\
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">\
<li>Go for a drive to ensure car as it normal operating temp (5 minute drive should be fine in warm areas, longer for colder areas).</li>\
<!--<li>Make sure you're logging &quot;CL/OL Status&quot;, &quot;Throttle Angle % Change&quot;, &quot;AFR Learning (LTFT)&quot;, &quot;"AFR Correction (STFT)"&quot;, &quot;AFR Stock Sensor&quot;, &quot;Engine Speed&quot;, and &quot;Engine Load&quot;</li>-->\
<li>Make sure you're logging &quot;CL/OL Status&quot;, &quot;AFR Learning (LTFT)&quot;, &quot;"AFR Correction (STFT)"&quot;, &quot;AFR Stock Sensor&quot;, &quot;Engine Speed&quot;, and &quot;Engine Load&quot;</li>\
    <ul>\
        <li>NO SUDDEN THROTTLE CHANGES - it is very important to keep throttle as smooth and consistent as possible. It is best to ONLY enable/start logging once you are at the signed speed for the street you are driving on and there is a good stretch of road for logging (ie. no stop lights etc). If you need to stop, slowdown, speed up quickly - you should disable/stop logging. Then when you are back at correct speed, enable/start logging again. If you continue to log data while you stop, start, speed up, slow down, with constant sudden throttle changes, the data collected can skew the results and your MAF scaling can be dramatically out for any MAFv where these sudden throttle changes occurred.</li>\
        <li>RECORD AT LEAST 30 minutes of highway/freeway driving in your top gear as close to the point where you switch from closed loop to open loop (eg if you use RomRaider for logging you can see when you switch from closed loop to open loop as the &quot;CL/OL Fueling&quot; value will change from &quot;8&quot; to &quot;10&quot;). A highway/freeway with a long, constant incline is best - this will allow you to gather data points for the upper most region of the closed loop section of your MAF Sensor Scaling table (MAFv of around 2.8v)</li>\
        <li>RECORD AT LEAST 30 minutes of general driving. This can include driving to/from shops, movies, work etc.</li>\
        <li>RECORD AT LEAST 15 minutes of slow speed driving - around an empty car park is best</li>\
<!--        <li>RECORD AT LEAST 5 minutes while you idle - BUT not while your car warms up. It is best to do this after you have done all the other driving above, as your car will be at running temp and the engine bay will be heatsoaked.</li>-->\
    </ul>\
<li>Open your tune in RomRaider</li>\
<li>Expand &quot;Mass Airflow /Engine Load&quot; tables group and copy &quot;MAF Sensor Scaling&quot; table by clicking &quot;Edit&quot;->&quot;Copy Table&quot; into the first cell of &quot;Current MAF Scaling&quot; table on the tool.</li>\
<li>Click &quot;POL Fueling&quot; button to set open loop fueling data. Expand &quot;Fueling - Primary Open Loop&quot; tables group and copy &quot;Primary Open Loop Fueling&quot; table by clicking &quot;Edit&quot;->&quot;Copy Table&quot; into the first cell of &quot;Primary Open Loop Fueling&quot; table on the tool. Click &quot;Validate&quot; button to make sure all is fine (validation is done on submitting the table so it's not required)</li>\
<li>Now you have two ways to proceed:<br />\
	<ul>\
		<li>If you have filtered CL single data file you can simply copy/paste that data into corresponding columns' first cell.</li>\
		<li>If you just have log file(s) - click on &quot;Load Log&quot; button, select your log file, select appropriate columns when prompted corresponding to asked data. You should pay attention to filters on some columns to filter out noisy data. Once the log file is processed you should see closed loop data populated in the table. Repeat this procedure to load more log files - the data will be appended to the table.</li>\
	</ul>\
</li>\
<li>At this point you can save all the input data for future reference or re-scaling by clicking on &quot;Save&quot; button at the top bar.</li>\
<li>Click on &quot;GO&quot; button at the top bar right corner to generate AFR data table and corrected MAF curve.</li>\
<li>Click on the &quot;Chart&quot; tab to see MAF corrected curve</li>\
</ol>\
<u>Chart Tab</u><br>\
<i>Note:</i><br>\
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use mouse wheel to zoom in/out.</i><br>\
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use Ctrl + left mouse button click to move the chart left/right/up/down (useful when chart is zoomed).</i><br>\
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hover mouse over a point to see point values for x/y axes.</i><br>\
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use left mouse button click-and-drag a curve point to move that point up/down (enabled for smoothing chart only).</i><br>\
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">\
<li>You can click on &quot;Total Correction&quot; checkbox to view total correction placement (scaling is on the right hand side)</li>\
<li>You can click on &quot;Current&quot; checkbox to view current MAF curve pasted into input &quot;Current MAF Scaling&quot; table on the  &quot;Data&quot; tab</li>\
<li>You can click on &quot;Corrected&quot; checkbox to view corrected MAF curve generated based on the CL data.</li>\
<li>You can click on &quot;Smoothed&quot; checkbox to view smoothed MAF curve. Keep in mind that initially this curve is the same as corrected curve. It will change if you apply smoothing and/or manual correction(s)</li>\
<br>\
<li>Click on &quot;Smoothed&quot; checkbox to view the resulting MAF scaling table and current MAF curve slope versus the corrected (or smoothed if changes are made) MAF curve slope</li>\
<li>Row 1 of the result table corresponds to &quot;MAF Sensor (volts)&quot; and row 2 of the &quot;Smoothing&quot; tab corresponds to &quot;Airflow (g/s)&quot;</li>\
<li>Again, this is where you now have two ways to proceed:<br />\
	<ul>\
		<li>quick - straight values copy<br />\
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">\
				<li>Simply copy the new generated &quot;Airflow (g/s)&quot; values from results table (located underneath the slope curves chart) for the corresponding &quot;MAF Sensor (volts)&quot; values directly into the appropriate place in your RommRaider &quot;MAF Sensor Scaling&quot; table.</li>\
			</ol>\
		</li>\
		<li>slow - apply smoothing<br />\
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">\
				<li>All smoothing changes are immediate and can be seen on the smoothing graph</li>\
				<li>If you have overdone smoothing, simply click on &quot;Reset&quot; button to set the smoothed curve back to corrected curve.</li>\
				<li>You can apply smoothing by selecting smoothing degree and clicking &quot;Apply&quot; button. Smoothing degree is simply a moving window size where 3 - uses 1 cell to left and right, 5 - uses 2 cells to left and right, and 7 - uses 3 cells to left and right.</li>\
				<li>BE CAREFULL not to smooth too much or you will end up making your MAF scaling worse. General suggestion is to apply either degree &quot;3&quot; or &quot;5&quot; once.</li>\
				<li>In addition, you can manually smoothen values by either dragging the smoothed curve's point or by applying +/-0.10 to the highlighted cells using buttons on the left from the result table. Keep in mind that selection all cells will raise or lower the whole curve. Thus you can raise certain parts of the curve by selecting appropriate cells.</li>\
				<li>Once you have smoothed the data to your liking, copy the data to your &quot;MAF Sensor Scaling&quot; table.</li>\
			</ol>\
		</li>\
	</ul>\
</li>\
<li>Once you have copied your new MAF scaling values from the result table to your ROM, save a new ROM with the changes made.</li>\
<li>Flash the modified ROM to your ECU and do another set of logs</li>\
</ol>\
